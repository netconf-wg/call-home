        <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">

          <t>This RFC presents NETCONF Call Home and RESTCONF Call Home,
          which enable a NETCONF or RESTCONF server to initiate a secure 
          connection to a NETCONF or RESTCONF client respectively.</t>

	  <t>NETCONF Call Home supports both of the secure transports used 
          by the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/>, SSH and TLS.
          The NETCONF protocol's binding to SSH is defined in <xref target="RFC6242"/>.
          The NETCONF protocol's binding to TLS is defined in 
          <xref target="draft-ietf-netconf-rfc5539bis"/>.</t>

          <t>RESTCONF Call Home only supports TLS, same as the RESTCONF protocol
          <xref target="draft-ietf-netconf-restconf"/>.  The RESTCONF protocol's
          binding to TLS is defined in <xref target="draft-ietf-netconf-restconf"/>.</t>

          <t>The SSH protocol is defined in <xref target="RFC4253"/>.  The TLS
          protocol is defined in <xref target="RFC5246"/>.  Both the SSH and TLS
          protocols are layered on top of the TCP protocol, which is defined in
          <xref target="RFC793"/>.</t>

          <t>Both NETCONF Call Home and RESTCONF Call Home preserve all but one 
          of the client/server roles in their respective protocol stacks, as when
          compared to standard NETCONF and RESTCONF connections.  The one and only
          role reversal that occurs is at the TCP layer; that is, in which peer is
          the TCP-client and which is the TCP-server.</t>

          <t>For example, a network
          element is traditionally the TCP-server however, when calling home, the
          network element becomes the TCP-client. The network element's secure
          transport layer roles (SSH-server, TLS-server) and its application layer
          roles (NETCONF-server, RESTCONF-server) both remain the same.</t>

          <t>Having consistency in both the secure transport layer (SSH, TLS) and 
          application layer (NETCONF, RESTCONF) roles conveniently enables deployed
          network management infrastructure to also support call home.  For instance, 
	  existing certificate chains and user authentication mechanisms are
	  unaffected by call home.</t>

          <section title="Motivation" anchor="motivation">
            <t>Call home is generally useful for both the initial deployment
            and on-going management of networking elements.  Here are some
            scenarios enabled by call home:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>The network element may proactively call home after
                being powered on for the first time in order to register
                itself with its management system.</t>
                <t>The network element may access the network in a way that
                dynamically assigns it an IP address, but does not register
                its assigned IP address to a mapping service.</t>
                <t>The network element may be deployed behind a firewall
                that implements network address translation (NAT)
                for all internal network IP addresses.</t>
                <t>The network element may be deployed behind a firewall
                that doesn't allow any management access to the internal 
                network.</t>
                <t>The network element may be configured in "stealth mode"
                and thus doesn't have any open ports for the management
                system to connect to.</t>
                <t>The operator may prefer to have network elements initiate
                management connections, believing it is easier to secure one
                open-port in the data center than to have an open port on
                each network element in the network.</t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </section>

          <section title="Requirements Terminology">
            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
            "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
            and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
            described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Applicability Statement">
            <t>The techniques described in this document are
            suitable for network management scenarios such
            as the ones described in <xref target="motivation"/>. However,
            these techniques are only defined for NETCONF Call Home
            and RESTCONF Call Home, as described in this document.</t>

            <t>The reason for this restriction is that different
            protocols have different security assumptions.  The NETCONF 
            and RESTCONF protocols require clients and servers to 
            verify the identity of the other party before starting the
            NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol (section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC6241"/> and
            sections 2.4 and 2.5 of <xref target="draft-ietf-netconf-restconf"/>).</t>

            <t>This contrasts with the base SSH and TLS protocols, which
            do not require programmatic verification of the other party
            (section 9.3.4 of <xref target="RFC4251"/>, section 4 of 
            <xref target="RFC4252"/>, and section 7.3 of <xref target="RFC5246"/>).
            In such circumstances, allowing the SSH/TLS server to contact the
            SSH/TLS client would open new vulnerabilities. Any use of call home
            with SSH/TLS for purposes other than NETCONF or RESTCONF will need 
            a thorough, contextual security analysis.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Update to RFC 4253">
            <t>This document updates the SSH Transport Layer Protocol
            <xref target="RFC4253"/> only in removing the statement "The client
            initiates the connection" made in Section 4 (Connection Setup).
	    Assuming the reference to client means "SSH client" and
	    the reference to connection means "TCP connection", this statement
	    doesn't hold true in call home, where the network element is the
	    SSH server and yet still initiates the TCP connection.  Security
            implications related to this change are discussed in Security
            Considerations (<xref target="sec-con"/>).</t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section title="The NETCONF or RESTCONF Client">
          <section title="Protocol Operation">
          <t>
            <list style="format C%d">
              <t>The NETCONF/RESTCONF client listens for TCP connection requests
	      from NETCONF/RESTCONF servers.  The client SHOULD listen for connections
	      on the IANA-assigned ports defined in section <xref target="iana-con"/>,
	      but MAY be configured to use a non-default port.</t>
              <t>The NETCONF/RESTCONF client accepts an incoming TCP
              connection request and a TCP connection is established.</t>
              <t>Using this TCP connection, the NETCONF/RESTCONF client MUST immediately
              start either the SSH-client <xref target="RFC4253"/> or the TLS-client
              <xref target="RFC5246"/> protocol.  For example, assuming the use of the 
	      IANA-assigned ports, the SSH-client protocol is started when the connection
	      is accepted on port PORT-X and the TLS-client protocol is started when the
	      connection is accepted on either port PORT-Y or PORT-Z.</t>
              <t>If using TLS, the NETCONF/RESTCONF client MUST advertise
              "peer_allowed_to_send", as defined by <xref target="RFC6520"/>.  This is
              required so NETCONF/RESTCONF servers can depend on it being there for
              call home connections, when keep-alives are needed the most.</t>
	      <t>As part of establishing an SSH or TLS connection, the NETCONF/RESTCONF
	      client MUST validate both the server's credentials and identity
	      (e.g., SSH host key, TLS certificate).  The client first validates the
	      server's credentials, either via previously trusted validation data 
	      (e.g., pinning, using the entire host key or certificate as the lookup key)
	      or via certificate path validation to a preconfigured trust anchor.  The
	      identity MAY then be derived from the pinned data or extracted from
	      the server's certificate (e.g., SubjectAltName).  Finally, the client
	      MUST validate the server's identity is one that it was expecting to 
	      connect to it.</t>
              <t>Once the SSH or TLS connection is established, the NETCONF/RESTCONF client
              MUST immediately start using either the NETCONF-client <xref target="RFC6241"/>
              or RESTCONF-client <xref target="draft-ietf-netconf-restconf"/> protocol. 
              Assuming the use of the IANA-assigned ports, the NETCONF-client protocol is
	      started when the connection is accepted on either port PORT-X or PORT-Y and
	      the RESTCONF-client protocol is started when the connection is accepted 
	      on port PORT-Z.</t>

            <list style="format S%d">
              <t>The NETCONF/RESTCONF server initiates a TCP connection request to
              the NETCONF/RESTCONF client.  The server SHOULD connect to
              one of the IANA-assigned ports defined in section <xref target="iana-con"/>,
              but MAY be configured to use a non-default port.  Using the IANA-assigned
	      ports, the server connects to port PORT-X for NETCONF over SSH, port 
	      PORT-Y for NETCONF over TLS, and port PORT-Z for RESTCONF over TLS.</t>
              <t>The TCP connection request is accepted and a TCP connection is

              <t>Using this TCP connection, the NETCONF/RESTCONF server MUST immediately

              <xref target="RFC5246"/> protocol, depending on how it is configured.  For
              example, assuming the use of the IANA-assigned ports, the SSH-server protocol
	      is used after connecting to the remote port PORT-X and the TLS-server protocol

              <t>If a persistent connection is desired, the NETCONF/RESTCONF server,

              the NETCONF/RESTCONF server
              SHOULD send HeartbeatRequest messages, as defined by <xref target="RFC6520"/>.
              For SSH based connections, per section 4 of <xref target="RFC4254"/>, the 
              NETCONF/RESTCONF server SHOULD send a SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST message

            <t>The security considerations described in 
            <xref target="RFC6242"/> and <xref target="draft-ietf-netconf-rfc5539bis"/>,
            and by extension <xref target="RFC4253"/>, 
            <xref target="RFC5246"/>, and <xref target="draft-ietf-netconf-restconf"/>
            apply here as well.</t>

            <t>This RFC deviates from standard SSH and TLS usage by having the 
	    SSH/TLS server initiate the underlying TCP connection.  This reversal
            is incongruous with <xref target="RFC4253"/>, which says "the client
	    initiates the connection" and also <xref target="RFC6125"/>, which says
	    "the client MUST construct a list of acceptable reference identifiers,
	    and MUST do so independently of the identifiers presented by the service."
	    To account for these variances, this RFC requires that the 
	    NETCONF/RESTCONF client be able to 1) validate the SSH host key via
	    pinning and/or PKI, 2) extract an identity from the server's SSH 
	    host-key or TLS certificate, and 3) validate that the identity is one
	    that the client was expecting to connect to it.</t>

            <t>An attacker could launch a denial of service (DoS) attack
	    on the NETCONF/RESTCONF client by 
            having it perform computationally expensive operations, before
            deducing that the attacker doesn't posses a valid key.
            This is no different than any secured service and all common 
            precautions apply (e.g., blacklisting the source address
            after a set number of unsuccessful login attempts).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana-con">
          <t>This RFC requests that IANA assigns three TCP port numbers
          in the "Registered Port Numbers" range with the service names
          "netconf-ch-ssh", "netconf-ch-tls", and "restconf-ch-tls".  These
          ports will be the default ports for NETCONF Call Home and RESTCONF
          Call Home protocols.  Below is the registration template following
          the rules in <xref target="RFC6335"/>.</t>
